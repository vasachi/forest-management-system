Welcome to my forest management system repository.

This management system is tailored for use in an area where a forest is to be established and helps to keep track of the seedlings and the tree species planted in that area. This system can be adoopted for use in a business dealing with the propagation of seedlings for sale to keep track of the number of seedlings and the tree species. In this project This system is mainly bulit of PHP and SQL for database and HTML and CSS for the web forms.
The inspiration of this project is drawn from community ran forests and conservation reserve areas in Kenya Central Rift.
